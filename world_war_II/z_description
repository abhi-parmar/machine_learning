About       :    Predict Maximum Temperature for a day , given features such as humidity , minimum temperature ,etc.

Note        :    I am also linking the cleaned data , which includes removing features which were not necessary to predict max. temperature, features that had 98% missing values and repetitive features( same features in different units of measurement.)  , filling missing values for important features.
